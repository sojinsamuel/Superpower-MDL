some Updates: Suppose the user is working on something else so they might have close the chrome browser or even their laptop or computer might be turned off at the time of notification goes off. 
so what happens is when they turn on their laptop or open back the chrome browser, we need a feature saying: 
"You missed the notification. [Drama Name] episode already released" or something like that so when they turn back on their system 
and when they open ups the browser they should see somekind of notification that they have missed it.

As of now i also want the notification to show up suppose the user has closed the chrome browser and lets say the notification alram time has already passed and the user opens the browser, so even in that cases if it should soon popup the notification. As of now i tested the notifcation in a test and closed t
